If you vote 0 for the first candidate, you can vote 1 for any number of remaining candidates.
You can vote 0 for every candidate. Every voter can do this, and the election will still end with 0 valid votes.

If this was a real system and they fixed that bug, an attacker can see which candidate each voter voted for by counting how many votes they sent (since they vote in a set order and stop once they vote 1). For now we can easily tell if someone voted 1 for the first candidate since they'll only vote once.

No random variables are used and the primes used to generate the keys are very small. 
Made a slight modification-> prints out table of encrypted votes just before it counts them. You can see that votes of 1 are always 18L and votes of 0 are always 20448L.
Added a bruteforce method to find the secret key by bruteforcing it and to decrypt the table of encrypted votes with this key
